# deep-learning-hologram



## Description
This porject is carried out under supervision from Prof Edmund Lam at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong. We are two summer interns from the University of Cambridge, working for Prof Lam for 10 weeks. We are tasked to generate computer-generated holograms using deep-learning algorithms.

## Dataset
We have four datasets for training and testing. The first one is the randomly generated intensity patterns, the second is the holograms produced by members of our laboratory, the third is the coco dataset downloaded from its website, and the fourth is the mnist hand-written digits. All images have been normalised, resized and converted to gray-scales.


## Networks
We have tested four networks, with and without the GAN structure, namely convolutional neural network(CNN), densenet, squeezenet and wide resnet(WRN). All can be found in the respective folders. The CNN structure is based on the method in a paper proposed by Dr Horisaki. All other networks and their authors can be found in the python files.
